# Cursor Rules for Rodafe Project

## Package Creation

When creating new Dart packages, use the very_good CLI:

```bash
very_good create dart_package my_dart_package --desc "My new Dart package"
```

This ensures consistent package structure and follows the very_good package template standards.
I usually use for create repositories, data sources, services, etc.

## Flutter Feature Creation

When creating new Flutter features in the lib directory, use the mason brick command:

```bash
mason make flutter_bloc_feature --name your_feature_name --type bloc --style equatable
```

This ensures consistent feature structure with BLoC pattern.

## Flutter Commands

Always use fvm for Dart or Flutter commands as specified in the project requirements.
